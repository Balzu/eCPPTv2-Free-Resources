# eCPPTv2-Additional-Resources
Additional, (almost always) Free Resources to prepare for eCPPTv2 exam (PTPv5 course)

## 1. System Security
###    1. Architecture Fundamentals

            * [Corelan post](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/)): introduces registries, stack, heap and other architecture components before performing buffer overflow. Good because pragmatic, stop readin before first buffer overflow for now.
            * [Princeton's Assembler part 1](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr18/cos217/lectures/13_Assembly1.pdf): introduces basic assembler structures. Good because short. Any Computer Architecture book is fine, but would flood with too many details for our purpose
            * [Princeton's Assembler part 2](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr18/cos217/lectures/14_Assembly2.pdf): introduces loops and the different addressing mechanisms. Can help understand how assembly code works.
            * [Princeton's Assembler part 3](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr18/cos217/lectures/15_AssemblyFunctions.pdf): this is very important part because introduces function calls and stack usage. Will need to understand carefully to perform stack-based buffer overflows.
            * [NASM video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPjBvZxE3E&ab_channel=UMBCIEEE): NASM is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. A nice introduction is given here by UMBC IEEE.
            * [Security protections against BO](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/teaching/f12-cs161/lectures/lec-4-sw-vuls-defense.pdf): Berkeley slides about Not Executable Memory, ASLR and Canary protections
            

###    2. Assembles Debuggers and Tool Arsenal

            * [Basic Reverse Engineering with Immunity]([https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/4hgFyEhWUC))): Debug of smalls c programs with Immunity Debugger
